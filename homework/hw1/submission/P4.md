# My Markdown File
## By Jack Sheehan
This is my **first** time using [`Markdown`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), can you believe that?

Markdown can be used for lots of things, such as:

1. Making different types of headers
2. Emphasizing text
3. Making lists
5. Adding links

| Making | Tables | Is  | Also | Cool |
| ------ | ------ | --- | ---- | ---- |
| but    | not    | as  | easy | :)   |
