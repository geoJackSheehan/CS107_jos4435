# Grading

You can earn 2 points per pair-programming exercise.  One for attendance and a
second point for your submission completed with solution.  Submitted solutions
are evaluated and mistakes are tolerated.  _Sloppy or weak solution attempts do
not get the completion mark for the submitted solution._  Please also see
[https://harvard-iacs.github.io/2022-CS107/pages/syllabus.html#pp-submission](https://harvard-iacs.github.io/2022-CS107/pages/syllabus.html#pp-submission).


# Submission instructions

Exercises performed during pair-programming sections should be put under version
control similar to homework assignments.

> _You must not branch off and create a pull-request for pair-programming
> exercises_.  Just add and commit your work on the `main` or `master` branch
> and push them to your repository (_make sure you are on the correct branch
> before you commit!_).

The following are the basic rules we apply for pair-programming submissions:

1. Your private repository should contain a directory named `lab` with
   sub-directories for each session. This session should be named `pp3`.
2. Within the sub-directory `pp3`, place the exercise files that you completed
   during the pair-programming section. The exercises must have the name
   `exercise_Y.ext` where `Y` corresponds to the exercise number and `ext` is
   the proper extension (`.py`, `.sh`, `.c`, `.cpp`) depending on the exercise.

Please commit these files in your private class repository _before the deadline_
in order to receive the credit for completeness.
